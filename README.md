This app provides a quick and simple method to install APK files to a device, even if the Android SDK is not installed on the system.

Simply drag an APK into the window, or select Download from URL and paste the location of a .zip containing an APK.

The app will display the name, version and launcher icon, along with a list of devices currently connected. Checking "Clean Install" will wipe any data related to the target app prior to installation.

Select the target device and press install. If the device isn't listed, verify USB debugging is enabled and press Refresh. Once installed, the application will automatically launch.
